/*
  Button

  Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital pin 13,
  when pressing a pushbutton attached to pin 2.

  The circuit:
  - LED attached from pin 13 to ground
  - pushbutton attached to pin 2 from +5V
  - 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground

  - Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
    attached to pin 13.

// variables will change:
int sensorState = 0;         // variable for reading the pushbutton status
int numOpens = 0;            // variable for recording the times the door is opened
int lastsensorState = 0;     // variable for recording whether the door was last opened or closed
