- Nice project idea. Do you think I'm your intended audience? What are you trying to say exactly, guys?
- Remove ALL help text (in italics) and images (e.g., the sample image). This document should be your writing ONLY.  
- Journals did not follow instructions (except for 1 day by Rusty). Pay attention to the prompts, and discussions about it in class.
- Pay attention to your Markdown formatting (see Files section for context). 
- A wiring diagram in initial design plan would have helped clarify the layout of the build and how it all interconnects.
- Your coding component could be more detailed. For instance, when does the door get set to lock? And why doesn't it ever unlock?
- Will delay functions suffice for controlling timing aspects? Or, do you need a Real-time clock (RTC) to do accurate date/time information?
- NO REFERENCES?!!?

## Purpose
The problem that we are trying to solve is over-eating and/or wasting energy, by locking users out of their refrigerator. Leaving the fridge door open for too long wastes energy and leaving the door open is a bad habit. Also, opening the fridge to grab snacks multiple times could also lead to weight problems that could easily be stopped. We will have a sensor to check how many times and how long a refrigerator is opened and lock the door after a specific amount of time.

## Initial Design Plan
Physical Components:
- A fridge, the primary subject
- electronic lock, locks the door when opened too many times and too long
- light sensor, checks when the door is opened
- laser, to point at the light sensor to send signals
- Arduino, used to program the locking mechanism

Coding Components
- timer
- code that sets the door to lock
- checker to see how many times the door opens

**Sample image**:

![A sample image to show how to add one to a repo](images/example.png "A sample image. This is the text that appears.")

**NOTE**: Your initial design plan may not fully reflect your final product,
as projects evolve over time.

## Files
*You'll complete this section as part of Milestone 1.*
images            - a folder which will contain images of the project hardware.
LICENSE           - It's the license that allows certain software usage for the project.
README.md         - the README.md is this document which will be used to help users understand what our product does.
example-README.md - an example to help developers create the README.md file.

## Summary
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project.*

Provide a brief summary description of the design and implementation,
including how much your initial design plan evolved, the final result
you achieved and the amount of time you spent as a programmer in
accomplishing these results, including any challenges overcome and
innovations that were not specifically required by the assignment.
This section should be no more than three paragraphs.

## Instructions
Explain how to use your product. 
This section should THOROUGHLY describe its usage (i.e., more than just "Push start").

## Errors and Constraints
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project.*

Every program has bugs. Use this section to create a bullet list of
all known errors and deficiencies that remain in your product. 
Also, list any constraints that must exist for your product to work 
(e.g., Only works in low light situations).

## Reflection
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project.*

Write 2 - 4 paragraphs on your reactions to the final project. 
Your reflection should be thoughtful and reflective. 
It is NOT a report about WHAT you did. 
Instead, it's a look back at what you learned by doing this project.
It should be critical of shortcomings (yours, as well as the instructors/assignments) 
as well as celebratory of what was achieved.

## References
*Start this section at the beginning of the project, and update it throughout.*

Throughout this project, you'll be used outside resources.
Reference ALL ideas or code which are not your own, and describe and
how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes
online sources, people who have helped you, and any other resources that
are not solely your own contribution. Lastly, include ALL resources you
looked at, not just the ones you ended up using directly.

## Final Self-Evaluations
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project. 
Assign points to each team member in each category, based on their contribution to the team. 
The sum of all member's points in each category cannot exceed 10. 
For example, for Coding, Partner 1 could get 7 points, and Partner 2 gets 3 points. 
You can't give both people 6 points each though, as the sum exceeds 10.

### Ideation, Brainstorming, Design:

*Partner 1 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

*Partner 2 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

### Code creation: 

*Partner 1 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

*Partner 2 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

### Documentation creation:

*Partner 1 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

*Partner 2 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

### Teamwork & Participation:

*Partner 1 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

*Partner 2 (replace this with your name): 0-10*

**A Note from Scott to You**

While I expect this project to have issues, one
thing to keep in mind is HAVE FUN with it! Create a product that
expresses your personal interests. Break up the writing so itâ€™s not so burdensome.
